  Our project is a course scheduling platform that will be used by students 
  when they enroll in classes. Its functionalities will be similar to Cornell's 
  Student Center, where students are able to shop for classes, view them, add,
  drop, as well as enroll in them. Students will not be able to enroll in 
  classes that occur at the same time, and will also make sure that they have 
  the correct prerequisites done. Users will be able to login into the
  interface, and their data will be saved.
